			<p>On this course, you’ll be taught by experienced statisticians working in health-related disciplines, who can frame examples relevant to your own profession to help your understanding.</p>
			<p>You’ll get to grips with designing, <a href="#">analysing and interpreting</a> findings from health research, as well as data types and how data is presented.</p>
			<p>You’ll look at how to summarise data, probability and probability distributions, the concept of sampling and statistical inference, a variety of hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric correlation, and methods of agreement.</p>
